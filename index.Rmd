Bioinformatics - the application of computational and analytical methods to biological problems - is a rapidly maturing field that is driving the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the avalanche of data in modern life sciences and medical research.  

I teach a range of Bioinformatics courses at undergraduate and graduate levels @ UC San Diego. Check out some of these courses below:
